### 4. **Workflows - Test/Debug Endpoint** ✅
**File:** `app/api/workflows/[id]/test/route.ts` (NEW)

**What was added:**
- Complete workflow testing endpoint
- Simulates execution without taking real actions
- Returns detailed step-by-step results
- Shows which steps would succeed/fail

**How to use:**
```javascript
// From your workflow UI, call:
fetch(`/api/workflows/${workflowId}/test`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'x-user-id': userId,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    testData: {
      email: 'test@example.com',
      // Add any other test trigger data
    }
  })
})
```

**What it returns:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "execution": {
    "id": "exec_123",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "workflowName": "Welcome Email Sequence",
    "totalSteps": 5,
    "stepsExecuted": 5
  },
  "steps": [
    {
      "stepName": "Send Welcome Email",
      "stepType": "SEND_EMAIL",
      "status": "COMPLETED",
      "duration": 45,
      "output": {
        "emailDetails": {
          "to": "test@example.com",
          "subject": "Welcome!",
          "sent": false,
          "testMode": true
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "note": "This was a test run. No real actions were taken."
}
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Simulates all step types (SEND_EMAIL, WAIT, TAG, CONDITION, etc.)
- ✅ Shows what WOULD happen without doing it
- ✅ Returns execution timing
- ✅ Identifies errors before going live
- ✅ Logs test executions in database for review

## 🔨 STILL NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION

### 5. **Lead Magnets - Publish/Unpublish** ⏳
**File needed:** `components/lead-magnets/LeadMagnetDashboard.tsx`

**What's needed:**
- Add publish button to each lead magnet card
- Status toggle between DRAFT ↔ ACTIVE
- Status badge on cards

**Quick implementation:**
```javascript
// Add this function
const handlePublish = async (magnetId, currentStatus) => {
  const newStatus = currentStatus === 'ACTIVE' ? 'DRAFT' : 'ACTIVE';

  const response = await fetch(`/api/lead-magnets/${magnetId}`, {
    method: 'PATCH',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'x-user-id': currUser.id,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ status: newStatus }),
  });

  if (response.ok) {
    toast.success(`Lead magnet ${newStatus === 'ACTIVE' ? 'published' : 'unpublished'}!`);
    loadLeadMagnets();
  }
};

// Add button in card
<button onClick={() => handlePublish(magnet.id, magnet.status)}>
  {magnet.status === 'ACTIVE' ? 'Unpublish' : 'Publish'}
</button>
```

### 6. **Workflows - Publish/Activate UI** ⏳
**File needed:** Find workflow list/builder page

**What's needed:**
- Add activate/deactivate button
- Status toggle between DRAFT ↔ ACTIVE
- Integration with test endpoint (test button)

**Quick implementation:**
```javascript
const handleActivate = async (workflowId, currentStatus) => {
  const newStatus = currentStatus === 'ACTIVE' ? 'DRAFT' : 'ACTIVE';

  await fetch(`/api/workflows/${workflowId}`, {
    method: 'PATCH',
    body: JSON.stringify({ status: newStatus }),
  });
};

const handleTest = async (workflowId) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/workflows/${workflowId}/test`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ testData: { email: 'test@example.com' } }),
  });

  const result = await response.json();
  console.log('Test result:', result);
  // Show result in modal/panel
};
```

## 🚀 USER WORKFLOW

**Standard publish flow for all features:**

1. **Create** → Status: DRAFT (not visible publicly)
2. **Edit/Build** → Still DRAFT
3. **Click Publish** → Status: PUBLISHED/ACTIVE (now public)
4. **Make changes** → Still published (changes apply live)
5. **Click Unpublish** → Back to DRAFT (hidden from public)

This matches standard CMS behavior (WordPress, Ghost, etc.)

---

## 📝 NEXT STEPS

1. **Implement Lead Magnet publish UI** (15 min)
2. **Add Workflow activate/test UI** (30 min)
3. **Test all publish flows** (20 min)
4. **Update API endpoints** if any don't support status field
5. **Add "View Public" links** next to publish buttons
